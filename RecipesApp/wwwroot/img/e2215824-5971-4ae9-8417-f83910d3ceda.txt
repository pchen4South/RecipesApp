What are you looking for in a new job?
I have significant fullstack experience and first and foremost I'd love to find a position where I can continue to exercise and grow these skills.
Another thing that's important to me is delivering a great end product to stakeholders/users, I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders / BA's / PM's / Devs to 
ship a great product. I'm also definitely looking for a place where I can continue to grow. Professional development is really important to me as I'd like to
advance to the senior engineering levels. I'd love a position where I can see my impact with my own eyes. I'm really excited with this opportunity at <company>
because I feel the impact would be great and far-reaching.

Whats ur current?
I’m not really comfortable sharing that information. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company and not what I’m paid at my current job.

I’m just not comfortable discussing my current or expected salary. I prefer to focus on the value I can add in this position, and I look forward to hearing what you think is appropriate.

I don’t have any particular numbers in mind. I’m more interested in learning whether this will be a good mutual fit. If it is, I’m open to exploring any offer so long as it’s competitive.
